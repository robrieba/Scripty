# Scripty

## An extensible CLI voice acting management tool for AGS.

Managing thousands of lines of speech in an adventure game can be frazzling.  Scripty can help.


```bash
Command:
  dump  Print a complete lising of every line of speech.

          $ ruby scripty dump ../my_ags_game

        Output:
          <character name>, <line number>, <speech text>

        Ex:
          CharacterName, 2, &2 Hello!
```
